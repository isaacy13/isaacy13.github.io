                    the front-end / database. Although the front-end is very far from perfect, it's functional enough to start working
                    on connecting it to the backend.

                  <p class="card-text less">In my Computer Organization class, we created the simplest computer components
                    from logic gates (using HDL) and used these components to build larger components like RAM. Eventually,
                    we combined our simple CPU, RAM, and a pre-built ROM32K to create a simple HACK computer. 
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text"> This experience of building from the ground up was valuable because it forced me to
                    understand even the little details in how simple computers work.

                    Additionally, it taught me valuable lessons for the software side of things (ie: applying cache management knowledge to make more efficient programs).
                    Overall, this project was a super fun dive into simple computers and helped me understand a little more about
                    how modern computers work.

                  <p class="card-text"> This Android OCR App was a personal project I made for the sole purpose of learning how to tinker with
                    OCR libraries and apply them in "real-world" scenarios. <i>Tesseract</i> was the name of the library I utilized and, for
                     my purposes, it was completely fine.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text"> This project was a fun learning experience as it was my first "higher-level" technology that I had always
                    heard about but never gotten to use myself. Additionally, it was really neat working with OCR since for the 
                    <i>Study Buddy App</i> project, I applied for the front-end team.

                  <p class="card-text"> The Study Buddy App was the first project I worked on as a team (as a part of <i>Aggie Coding Club</i>).
                    Originally, the idea had originated from a hackathon: notes that you take on paper should be easily transferred to a digital
                    format and could potentially be automatically organized.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text"> I thought the idea was really cool, so I joined the sub-group as part of the front-end team. There, I
                    helped developed the majority of the front-end and communicated with the project manager & OCR team, seeing what they needed.
                    Overall, one of my favorites, as working with other like-minded people was really cool (especially during the pandemic).

                  <p class="card-text"> The Discord Photoroulette Bot was made for a Discord Bot competition in <i>Aggie Coding Club</i>. 
                    The purpose of this bot was to have players send in their pictures from which the bot would randomly select from.
                    Showing the rest of the server the selected picture, everyone would take turns guessing whose picture it was.
                  </p>
                  <p class="card-text"> Aside from being a neat party game, this project was a lot of fun because it was the first time
                    I placed in a coding competition (ended up second place and got a cool keyboard). This project further increased my interest
                    in code (as it was my freshman year where I hadn't declared a major). Overall a cool memory and quite possibly contributed
                    to the reason I enjoy coding.
